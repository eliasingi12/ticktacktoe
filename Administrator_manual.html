<pre><code>borð hérna!

<p>For an example player can type in number 1 to 9 and then press Enter. Player 1 types in 3, then <strong>X</strong> will come in place 3 instead of the number 3. The board will look like that: </p>
<pre><code>borð hérna!
</code></pre>
<p>Then there is players 2 turn to play. He will type in 7, and the place 7 will now be <strong>O</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>borð hérna!
</code></pre>
<p>The first one to get 3 in a row wins the game. </p>
