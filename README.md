# Tic Tac Toe

This late-term assignment in Hugbúnaðarfræði is to learn to set up technical infrastructure to support agile development. We are supposed to glue together the bits and pieces through the latter half of this class, into a coherent infrastructure. We are doing that by making a simple game, Tic Tac Toe.
