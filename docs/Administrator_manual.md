### How to play the game
**hvað þarf hann að gera til að komast inn í leikinn?**

**hvernig spilar leikmaður leikinn?**

	borð hérna!

For an example player can type in number 1 to 9 and then press Enter. Player 1 types in 3, then **X** will come in place 3 instead of the number 3. The board will look like that: 

	borð hérna!

Then there is players 2 turn to play. He will type in 7, and the place 7 will now be **O**.

	borð hérna!

The first one to get 3 in a row wins the game.
